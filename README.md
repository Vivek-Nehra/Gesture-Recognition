# Gesture-Recognition
Detecting hand gestures using Image Processing in Python
Using concept of convex hull and contour detection , user hand can be successfully detected showing the number of convex points( Fingertips ) and defect points ( between 2 finger tips ) , which can be explicitly programmed by user to create multipe gestures .. Moreover, 2 hands can be used if more number of gestures is required..

Note: Use trackbar to change values of threshed image , such that hand can be detected successfully with minimum background     noise
